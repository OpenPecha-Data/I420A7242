So there will be no such thing as ignorance (avdiyā), nor yet freedom from ignorance, and therefore these can be none of 
its consequences (viz., the twelve nidānas. Colebrooke p.255); and therefore no such thing as decay or death (jarā or ma
raṅa), nor yet freedom from decay and death. So neither can there be a method (or way) for destroying the concourse of s
orrows. No such thing as wisdom, and no such thing as attaining (happiness or rest), as there will not be ought that can
be attained.
