Therefore know that this Prajnā Pāramitā is the the Great Spiritual Dhāraṇī,–it is the Great Light-giving Dhāraṇī. This i
s the unsurpassed Dhāraṇī. This is the unequalled Dhāraṇī, able to destroy all sorrows. True and real, (i.e., full of me
aning), not vain (i.e., unmeaning).Therefore we repeat (or let us repeat) the Prajnā Pāramitā Dhāraṇī.Then also say–Ki-t
ai, Ki-tai, Po-lo, Ki-tai, Po-lo-seng-Ki-tai, Bo-tāi-sah-po-ho. i.e. [according to M. Julien’s system]: Gati Gati, Parag
ati, Parasangati, Bodhisatvah, [words I cannot attempt to explain.]
